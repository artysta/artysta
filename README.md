### Hi there! I am Adrian!

Welcome to my GitHub profile where you can check out some of my projects. These are not perfect, but I am still learning.

If you want, you can also visit one of my websites:
  - https://artysta.github.io/ - just GitHub Page containing my CV in simplified version,
  - http://adriankurek.pl/ - my private website, where you can read some articles about programming languages & technologies - it is available only in Polish at this moment.

If you want to contact me for any reason you can use one of my e-mails or LinkedIn profile:
  - kontakt@adriankurek.pl,
  - adrian.kurek93@gmail.com,
  - https://www.linkedin.com/in/adrian-kurek/.
