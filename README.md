### Hi there! I am Adrian!

Welcome on my GitHub profile where you can check out some of my projects. These are not perfect, but I am still learning new things.

If you want, you can also visit one of my websites:
  - https://artysta.github.io/ - just simple GitHub Page,
  - http://adriankurek.pl/ - my private website, where you can read some articles about programming languages & technologies, it is available only in Polish at this moment (I will create an English version of this website if I have free time - unfortunately day is only 24 hours long ðŸ˜¢)

If you want to contact me from any reason you can use one of my e-mails or LinkedIn profile:
  - kontakt@adriankurek.pl | adrian.kurek93@gmail.com,
  - https://www.linkedin.com/in/adrian-kurek/.
